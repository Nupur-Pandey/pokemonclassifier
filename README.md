This project is a Pokémon classifier that utilizes the ResNet architecture to identify different Pokémon species from images. The ResNet model is a powerful deep learning model known for its ability to handle very deep networks without vanishing or exploding gradients, making it suitable for complex tasks like image classification.
The dataset used for this project consists of images of various Pokémon species. It has been preprocessed and labeled with the corresponding Pokémon species to use for training and evaluation. The model architecture used for this project is the ResNet (Residual Network). We will be using a pre-trained ResNet model and fine-tune it for our Pokémon classification task. The pre-trained model's weights will be used as a starting point to speed up training and improve accuracy.
